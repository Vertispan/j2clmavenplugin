/**
 * This test is a bit more complex than it perhaps needs to be, to let us verify in one single test+pom
 * that assertions are working in our various expected states. The pom should specify the assertion.armed
 * property so that this file knows whether or not to expect that the assertions are alive and will go
 * off if they fail.
 *
 * Note that this will fail in BUNDLE/BUNDLE_JAR mode since closure can't optimize out asserts.
