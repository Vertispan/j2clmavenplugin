/**
 * Currently unused, this enum is meant to give the pom.xml author the power to decide when
 * the j2cl plugin should generate code via annotation processors, and when the maven build
 * will take care of that.
 *
 * For now, only IGNORE_MAVEN is properly supported, it seems that maven doesn't include the
 * generated-sources/annotations directory to reactor projects not currently being evaluated,
 * so we might need to ignore the source directory entirely, and just consume the "artifact"
 * of that reactor project (which might be the target/classes directory, etc).
