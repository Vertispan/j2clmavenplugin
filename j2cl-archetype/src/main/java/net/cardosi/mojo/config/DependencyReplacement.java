/**
 * Config wiring to indicate that some dependency should be universally replaced with some
 * other dependency (possibly not yet resolved). This will necessarily change the hash for
 * any project which uses the original dependency, so that two projects with different
 * dependency replacement rules may not share one or more cache entries, since those
 * cache entries were built against different dependencies.
 *
 * Note that replacement may be null/blank, indicating that the original should just be
 * removed when compiling with this plugin.
 *
 * POTENTIAL FUTURE FEATURE:
 * If the replacement coordinate is provided and it is resolvable in the current project, that
 * will be used instead of relying on the version specified in the coordinates. Otherwise, the
 * precise coordinates will be followed.
 *
 * Also affects closure/bundle, but isn't designed specifically to be used for that purpose,
 * use normal maven dependency tools (exclusions, etc) for that.
